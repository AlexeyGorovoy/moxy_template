# Dagger, Retrofit, RxJava, Moxy template project
Template project to simplify and speed up basic project creation / setup routine. 

Originally based on [this project by @yassine-gharsallah](https://github.com/yassine-gharsallah/marvel), but with the addition on Moxy it has been changed tremendously and I decided to move it from forked project to a separate repository.

Libraries included:
- [Moxy](https://github.com/Arello-Mobile/Moxy)
- [Cicerone](https://github.com/terrakok/Cicerone)
- [Dagger (2.x)](https://github.com/google/dagger)
- [RxJava (2.x)](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
- [RxAndroid (2.x)](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)

- a bunch of AndroidX libraries.

All libraries included are the latest versions available on March 01, 2019.
